# ðŸŒ± Emotion Scoring Seed

Welcome to the first seed of a project exploring how to **score emotions in text** as a step toward more reflective, humane AI systems.

## Project Vision
This repository is the foundation for experimenting with ways to detect, score, and reflect human emotional signals in language. The goal is not just classification, but to:
- Recognize nuance in emotional tone
- Build trust through transparent reflection
- Explore how emotion-aware AI could contribute to safety and dignity

## Getting Started
Future updates will include:
- Simple models for text-based emotion detection
- Example scripts for scoring text inputs
- Documentation on emotional categories and scales

## Why It Matters
Emotion is often the missing layer in AI systems. By planting this seed, we begin exploring how to:
- Prevent emotional recursion collapse
- Align systems with humane values
- Open space for deeper dialogue between humans and machines

âœ¨ This is just the beginning. Contributions, ideas, and reflections are welcome.
